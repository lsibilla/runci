# RunCI
This project is a vendor-agnostic tool for supporting container based CI/CD
pipelines.

RunCI mainly relies on docker and docker-compose for running isolated and
agent-independent tasks in a sequential or parallel manner.

## Configuration
The configuration is done in a compose-like YML sepcification file that can be
reused by developpers for local development.

See [runci.yml](./runci.yml) for an example.

## Current status
The project is in very early stage. Don't hesitate to contribute or come back later !
